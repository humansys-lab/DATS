Generate 20 patterns of sentences defining three variables in English. The variable should be [VAR] and the definition should be [DEF]. However, the following three conditions must be observed.
(1) If there is more than one variable, use subscripts such as [VAR_1], [VAR_2], and so on. Similarly, the definitions should also be [DEF_1], [DEF_2].
(2) Generated sentences should be separated by " " and a comma (,) should be placed at the end.
(3) Generate sentences in various patterns. The generated sentences should be assumed to be in a chemistry-related paper. Sentences that are not natural or identical to the examples will not be accepted.

Some examples are shown below.
"We introduce three variables, [VAR_1], [VAR_2], and [VAR_3], with corresponding definitions of [DEF_1], [DEF_2], and [DEF_3 ]." ,
